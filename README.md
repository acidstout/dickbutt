# Dickbutt Bookmarklet
This will plaster a website with randomly sized and positioned dickbutts. Uses an inline SVG image in order to eliminate external references.

# Usage
Create a new bookmark in your browser with the content of the dickbutt.min.js file (you may use the dickbutt.js file as well, but it's not minified) as URL and prepend 'javascript:' as protocol. Click the newly created bookmark on any website to have it plastered with dickbutts.

# Known issues
Due to the nature of adding multiple elements to the DOM this will become noticably slower if the number of dickbutts is increased.
